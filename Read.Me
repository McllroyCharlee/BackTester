This is a simple back testing script
You can chnage the ticker symbol, back testing start and end tme, re-samplerate which is timeframe and qty.
currently i am using MACD study, but can easily change to use any study that give a postive or negative signal for the timeframe
This will run the back testing and dispaly a plot for the historical price of the symbol and the MACD chart, with the profit or loss calculated

You are welcome to make any changes to improve the code.
